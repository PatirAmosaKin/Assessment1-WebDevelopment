        <h2>Reviews</h2>
        <p>Critics and players alike have praised Fire Emblem: Three Houses for its complex story, deep characters, and strategic gameplay. The game has been lauded for its replayability, with multiple story paths that offer different perspectives and outcomes.</p>
        <p>It has been called one of the best tactical RPGs of the decade, earning high marks for its emotional depth, music, and immersive world-building.</p>
        <p>There are however varying opinions on the game, here are just some of the reviews from google reviews on what different user's think of the game:</p>
        <p><strong>Shi zuii - </strong>Three Houses is one of the most acclaimed games on the switch & won 2019 players’ choice. Nuff said.
    
            Take one look at the millions of inspired pieces of fan content (and even the passion-filled content from the voice actors, official artists, and spin-offs!) online, and you can tell this game is a phenomenon, and for good reason. The story is incredibly engrossing alongside a loveable cast of characters that players can’t get enough of with beautifully written, witty and impactful dialogue thoughtfully localized to make each character truly feel human and give each line purpose, and the land they live in is one of the most fleshed out fantasy worlds you’ll find. The characters, story and world communicate strong themes of perspective and understanding in a cautionary tale underscored by its gameplay mechanics. The gameplay itself is some of the most innovative and unique gameplay on the console, innovating for its franchise, scratching a realistic tactical itch like no other which will have you thinking like Alexander the Great on its higher difficulties. The gameplay and story combine (along with unforgettable music that I’ve yet to see topped by another RPG aside from maybe Persona or Nier and amazing art direction brought to life by high-quality, full-voice acting) and play off of each other to create one of the internet’s favorite gaming experiences.
            
            If you haven’t played Fire Emblem Three Houses, you’re missing out!</p>
        <p><strong>Noelle Solano - </strong>One of the best games I have ever played! This game has really changed how I view different tactical RPGs. I have played many Fire Emblem games, but this one was definitely one of my favorites. I loved how the game helped us get to know our units more with the supports, and I loved the story line for all four of the routes. 
    
            I really feel that this game had some very good graphics, and the units skills were amazing. I think Felix was my absolute favorite character, and I spent many hours putting effort into making him my best unit, which payed off. I think all the units were amazing when it came to skills, but there are certain units in the routes with skills that definitely stand out. 
            
            The character development and writing is amazing, and I really believe that this is one of the best games for the Nintendo Switch. Really the only feedback I would give is the lack of inclusion of the units in the cut scenes. I really would have liked to see that, but other than that, the game was absolutely amazing. Thank you Nintendo!</p>
        <p><strong>Sister of Night - </strong>This is by far one of the best FE’s I’ve ever played. Maybe even the best. Sounds funny but the game changed my life. Everything is perfect - 4 different stories plus 1 hidden, the wonderful realistic characters and their captivating storylines, the amazing gameplay and the interesting side quests! Since release I’m playing it at least twice a year. A must-have game for EVERY gamer in the universe.</p>
