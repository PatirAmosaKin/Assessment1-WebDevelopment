    <h2>Ingredients for the dough</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
        <li>4 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup warm milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup melted unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients for the filling</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>3 tbsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 cup softened unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients for the icing</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
        <li>4 oz cream cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 tbsp milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step-by-step Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Dough: In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of the flour, sugar, and salt. In a separate bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water and warm milk. Let it sit for 5–10 minutes, or until the mixture becomes frothy.</li>
        <li>Mix Wet and Dry Ingredients: Once the yeast mixture is frothy, add it to the flour mixture, along with the melted butter and eggs. Stir to combine. Gradually add the remaining 2 cups of flour, mixing until a dough starts to form.</li>
        <li>Knead the Dough: Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes until it’s smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean towel, and let it rise for 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Cinnamon Filling: In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar and cinnamon. In another small bowl, melt the softened butter. Set both aside for later.</li>
        <li>Roll Out the Dough: After the dough has risen, punch it down to release air. Turn it out onto a floured surface and roll it into a rectangle, about 16x12 inches in size.</li>
        <li>Add the Cinnamon Filling: Brush the dough with the softened butter, leaving about a 1-inch border. Evenly sprinkle the cinnamon and brown sugar mixture over the buttered dough.</li>
        <li>Roll Up the Dough: Starting from one edge, carefully roll the dough tightly into a log. Slice the rolled dough into 12 equal pieces (about 1-1.5 inches each).</li>
        <li>Prepare the Baking Pan: Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan and arrange the sliced rolls in it. Leave a little space between each roll for them to expand while baking. Cover the pan with a towel and let the rolls rise for another 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bake the Rolls: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake the cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top.</li>
        <li>Make the Cream Cheese Glaze: While the rolls are baking, prepare the glaze by combining the softened cream cheese, softened butter, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and milk in a bowl. Mix until smooth and creamy. Adjust the milk to reach your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Glaze the Cinnamon Rolls: Once the rolls are out of the oven, let them cool for about 5 minutes. Drizzle the cream cheese glaze over the warm cinnamon rolls.</li>
        <li>Serve and Enjoy: Serve the cinnamon rolls warm for the best experience! Enjoy the soft, gooey goodness!</li>
