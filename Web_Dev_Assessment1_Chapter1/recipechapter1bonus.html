    </ul>

    <h2 id="italize">Ingredients for the icing</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
        <li>4 oz cream cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 tbsp milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="italize">Step-by-step Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Dough: In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of the flour, sugar, and salt. In a separate bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water and warm milk. Let it sit for 5–10 minutes, or until the mixture becomes frothy.</li>
        <h4>The reason why the yeast is seperated and is not incorporated into the dry ingredients is in order to proof it. Proofing yeast is done in order to ensure that the yeast hasn't spoiled yet and can still be used, and also to leaven and ferment dough.</h4>
        <li>Mix Wet and Dry Ingredients: Once the yeast mixture is frothy, add it to the flour mixture, along with the melted butter and eggs. Stir to combine. Gradually add the remaining 2 cups of flour, mixing until a dough starts to form.</li>
        <li>Knead the Dough: Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes until it’s smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean towel, and let it rise for 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Cinnamon Filling: In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar and cinnamon. In another small bowl, prepare the softened butter. Set both aside for later.</li>
        <li>Roll Out the Dough: After the dough has risen, punch it down to release air. Turn it out onto a floured surface and roll it into a rectangle, about 16x12 inches in size.</li>
        <li>Add the Cinnamon Filling: Brush the dough with the softened butter, leaving about a 1-inch border. Evenly sprinkle the cinnamon and brown sugar mixture over the buttered dough.</li>
        <li>Roll Up the Dough: Starting from one edge, carefully roll the dough tightly into a log. Slice the rolled dough into 12 equal pieces (about 1-1.5 inches each).</li>
        <li>Prepare the Baking Pan: Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan and arrange the sliced rolls in it. Leave a little space between each roll for them to expand while baking. Cover the pan with a towel and let the rolls rise for another 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bake the Rolls: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake the cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top.</li>
        <li>Make the Cream Cheese Glaze: While the rolls are baking, prepare the glaze by combining the softened cream cheese, softened butter, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and milk in a bowl. Mix until smooth and creamy. Adjust the milk to reach your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Glaze the Cinnamon Rolls: Once the rolls are out of the oven, let them cool for about 5 minutes. Drizzle the cream cheese glaze over the warm cinnamon rolls.</li>
        <li>Serve and Enjoy: Serve the cinnamon rolls warm for the best experience! Enjoy the soft, gooey goodness!</li>
    <h3>As an alternative for step 4 and 6, you can also melt the butter and then mix together the brown sugar and cinnamon powder until you form a paste. Then apply that paste throughout the flattened dough. Whichever method works best is up to preference. Happy baking to you all! <3</h3>
